# Agent guidance for RDIRecruit

This project uses [Addy Osmani's agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) for engineering quality. The full pack of 24 skills (23 lifecycle + 1 meta) is installed as Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` — each file is a verbatim copy of the upstream `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Provenance and content hashes are pinned in `skills-lock.json` (source `addyosmani/agent-skills`, commit `3a6fc6392823e31e2362091bd4e3cddf5b77af14`).

Follow these when building features, especially the triage decision flow, auth, and candidate PII handling.

## Product

RDIRecruit is a **candidate-triage decision tool** that protects interview time: cut weak candidates first, rank who to interview, then build a deep read only for the ones worth it. There are **no numeric scores and no tiers** — only the decision vocabulary _Interview first · Short screen · Verify first · Hold · Cut · Review blocked_. Workable stays the ATS of record.

- UI: `src/components/triage/` (`triage-app`, `pool-screen`, `candidate-screen`, `use-workspace`, `context`).
- Domain + data: `src/lib/triage/` (`types`, `theme`, `from-supabase` mapper, `load` server loader, `store` + `working-file` for the `.md`, `recalc` for the Claude re-derive).
- The app is **server-fed from Supabase** (`src/app/page.tsx` Server Component → `loadTriagePool`). Real tables: `candidates`, `applications`, `scores`, `ro_assessments`, `evaluations`, `narratives`, `candidate_overlay`, and `candidate_working_files` (migration `009`).
- **No numeric scores/tiers in the UI** — `scores` is used only to derive a decision from the vocabulary; everything surfaced maps from real data or degrades gracefully.
- Human edits persist to Supabase via `src/app/actions/triage.ts`: disqualify → `candidate_overlay`; timeline/replies/corrections/transcripts/run-deep → `candidate_working_files.workspace`. Optimistic in the UI.
- Each candidate has one living `.md` working file in `candidate_working_files.content`; **Save correction & re-analyze / Save transcript & analyze / Run deep analysis** call Claude (server-side, Clerk-gated, resilient) to re-derive the decision read and write it back.
- Connectors are preserved under `src/lib/` and `src/app/api/`; the previous scoring-centric UI/docs live in `archive/`.
- Keep the build Vercel-deployable on `main` (Clerk env-driven, no hardcoded secrets).

- `security-and-hardening.md` — OWASP Top 10, auth, secrets, dependency auditing
- `performance-optimization.md` — Measure-first; Core Web Vitals, profiling, bundles

**Ship**

- `git-workflow-and-versioning.md` — Trunk-based development, atomic commits
- `ci-cd-and-automation.md` — Shift Left, feature flags, quality gate pipelines
- `deprecation-and-migration.md` — Code-as-liability, migration patterns, zombie removal
- `documentation-and-adrs.md` — Architecture Decision Records, document the *why*
- `observability-and-instrumentation.md` — Structured logging, RED metrics, tracing
- `shipping-and-launch.md` — Pre-launch checklists, staged rollouts, rollback

Supabase agent skills (`.agents/skills/`):

- `supabase` — Supabase CLI, MCP, migrations, auth, RLS
- `supabase-postgres-best-practices` — Postgres performance and schema guidance

## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router on Vercel
- Clerk for authentication (Marketplace integration)
- Supabase for Postgres + storage
- Workable SPI v3 for ATS sync

## Auth

All app routes require Clerk login. Webhooks (`/api/hooks/*`) and cron (`/api/cron/*`) stay public with their own secrets.
